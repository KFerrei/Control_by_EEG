# Project Overview

This project, conducted in collaboration with THALES France, aims to develop an innovative brain-computer interface (BCI) system utilizing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to explore P300 and SSVEP responses. 
The project is part of a coursework assignment for IMT Atlantique, Brest.

# Objectives
- Design and implement an EEG signal acquisition and processing system.
- Extract P300 and SSVEP features from the acquired EEG data.
- Explore potential applications of the BCI system.
  
# Methodology
- Data Acquisition: EEG signals has been recorded from participants using a dedicated EEG acquisition system.
- Signal Preprocessing: The acquired EEG data has been preprocessed to remove noise and artifacts, ensuring clean signals for further analysis.
- Feature Extraction: P300 and SSVEP features has been extracted from the preprocessed EEG data.
    - P300 features are typically related to event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by specific stimuli
    - SSVEP features are associated with ongoing oscillatory responses evoked by visual stimuli.
